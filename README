README

This is a repository for a set of tools used for working with the Ann Arbor District Library catalog.  It is intended to include the following:

greasemonkey/

Greasemonkey scripts to monkey around with the catalog and with other book information sources including Google Book Search and Amazon

wall-of-books/

Extract lists of new or popular books from the AADL catalog and format them as pages with links to the catalog and to other book information sources

tools/

Support tools for the above, mostly simple scripts to extract data from the catalog, transform it by coordinating with other book information sources, and generate reports for display.  Nothing fancy, mostly in shell for now.
